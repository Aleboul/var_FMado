# var_FMado
Python module which compute numerically the asymptotic variance of the lambda-FMadogram with missing data. Perform Monte Carlo simulation to asses in finite-sample setting the theoretical results. It also gives tools to simulate some extreme value copulas.

The reproduce folder contains codes to reproduce the figures of the report.

A tutorial (with a notebook) is available to see how to simulate copulas using the code in tutorial file.
